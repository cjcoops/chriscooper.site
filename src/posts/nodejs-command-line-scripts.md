As A JavaScript developer I write 99% of my code in JavaScript (or TypeScript). So when I want to write a command line script I'd much rather write it in JavaScript than in bash because:

- I don't need to continually Google syntax
- I can use the npm ecosystem to utilize 3rd party packages I'm already comfortable using

This article will cover the fundamentals when writing command line scripts with Node.js, most of which I learned from Kyle Sampson's [Digging Into Node.js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/digging-into-node/) course on Frontend Masters.
